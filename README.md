# drainage_grid
This program takes in a 2D array of values representing elevations. Utilizing dynamic programming, it prints the longest path water can flow in the grid by coordinates. Water can only flow to an adjacent (not diagonal) space in the grid with a smaller value. Use a python IDE to run this project. Run read_grid.py to enter the input. The first line of the input should be the number of rows, a space, and the number of columns. The following lines should contain the values of the grid with spaces in between each value and a new line for each row. Type the input in a notepad and copy it over to the console. 8x8.txt contains a sample input. The output prints in the order of highest to lowest, with 0 counting as an index in row column format.
